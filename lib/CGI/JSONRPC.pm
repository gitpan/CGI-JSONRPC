=head1 NAME

CGI::JSONRPC - CGI handler for JSONRPC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use CGI;
  use CGI::JSONRPC;
  my $cgi = new CGI;
  CGI::JSONRPC->handler($cgi);
  exit;
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CGI::JSONRPC is a pole for perl.

CGI::JSONRPC implements the JSONRPC protocol as defined at
L<http://www.json-rpc.org/>. When a JSONRPC request is received by
this handler, it is translated into a method call. The method and
it's arguments are determined by the JSON payload coming from the
browser, and the package to call this method on is determined by
the C<JSONRPC_Class> apache config directive.

A sample "dispatcher" module is supplied,
L<CGI::JSONRPC::Dispatcher|CGI::JSONRPC::Dispatcher>

B<Note:> I<This documentation is INCOMPLETE and this is an alpha release.
The interface is somewhat stable and well-tested, but other changes may
come as I work in implementing this on my website.>

=head1 USAGE

When contacted with a GET request, CGI::JSONRPC will reply with the
contents of JSONRPC.js, which contains code that can be used to create
JavaScript classes that can communicate with their Perl counterparts.
See the /examples/hello.html file for some sample JavaScript that uses
this library, and /examples/httpd.conf for the corresponding Perl.

When contacted with a POST request, CGI::JSONRPC will attempt to
process and dispatch a JSONRPC request. If a valid JSONRPC request was
sent in the POST data, the dispatcher class will be called, with the
following arguments:

=over

=item $class

Just like any other class method, the first argument passed in will be
name of the class being invoked.

=item $id

The object ID string from the JSONRPC request. In accordance with the
json-rpc spec, your response will only be sent to the client if this
value is defined.

=item @params

All further arguments to the method will be the arugments passed to the 
JSONRPC constructor.  It is expected to be a hash of key value option
pairs.

=back

If the client specified an C<id>, your method's return value will be serialized
into a JSON array and sent to the client as the "result" section of the
JSONRPC response.

=head2 The default dispatcher

The default dispatcher adds another layer of functionality; it expects the
first argument in @params to be the name of the class the method is being
invoked on. See L<CGI::JSONRPC::Dispatcher> for more details on that.
