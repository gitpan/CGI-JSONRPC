NAME
    CGI::JSONRPC - CGI handler for JSONRPC

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI;
      use CGI::JSONRPC;
      my $cgi = new CGI;
      CGI::JSONRPC->handler($cgi);
      exit;

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::JSONRPC is a pole for perl.

    CGI::JSONRPC implements the JSONRPC protocol as defined at
    <http://www.json-rpc.org/>. When a JSONRPC request is received by this
    handler, it is translated into a method call. The method and it's
    arguments are determined by the JSON payload coming from the browser,
    and the package to call this method on is determined by the
    "JSONRPC_Class" apache config directive.

    A sample "dispatcher" module is supplied, CGI::JSONRPC::Dispatcher

    Note: *This documentation is INCOMPLETE and this is an alpha release.
    The interface is somewhat stable and well-tested, but other changes may
    come as I work in implementing this on my website.*

USAGE
    When contacted with a GET request, CGI::JSONRPC will reply with the
    contents of JSONRPC.js, which contains code that can be used to create
    JavaScript classes that can communicate with their Perl counterparts.
    See the /examples/hello.html file for some sample JavaScript that uses
    this library, and /examples/httpd.conf for the corresponding Perl.

    When contacted with a POST request, CGI::JSONRPC will attempt to process
    and dispatch a JSONRPC request. If a valid JSONRPC request was sent in
    the POST data, the dispatcher class will be called, with the following
    arguments:

    $class
        Just like any other class method, the first argument passed in will
        be name of the class being invoked.

    $id The object ID string from the JSONRPC request. In accordance with
        the json-rpc spec, your response will only be sent to the client if
        this value is defined.

    @params
        All further arguments to the method will be the arugments passed in
        the "params" section of the JSONRPC request.

    If the client specified an "id", your method's return value will be
    serialized into a JSON array and sent to the client as the "result"
    section of the JSONRPC response.

  The default dispatcher
    The default dispatcher adds another layer of functionality; it expects
    the first argument in @params to be the name of the class the method is
    being invoked on. See CGI::JSONRPC::Dispatcher for more details on that.
